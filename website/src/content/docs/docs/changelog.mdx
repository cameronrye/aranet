- Full AranetRn+ (Radon) sensor support with 4-byte radon history values
- History V2 protocol parsing with 10-byte header format
- `aranet-types` crate for platform-agnostic shared types
- WebAssembly module foundation (`aranet-wasm`)

### Fixed
- UUID mappings for history characteristics
- V2 history parsing header format

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-16 <Badge text="Current" variant="success" />

### Core Library (aranet-core)

- **Device Discovery** — Scan for nearby Aranet devices via BLE
- **Current Readings** — CO₂, temperature, pressure, humidity, radon, radiation
- **Historical Data** — Download measurement history with timestamps (V1 + V2 protocols)
- **Device Settings** — Read/write measurement interval, Bluetooth range
- **Auto-reconnection** — Configurable backoff and retry logic
- **Real-time Streaming** — Subscribe to sensor value changes via notifications
- **Multi-device Manager** — Manage multiple sensors simultaneously
- **Event System** — Connect/disconnect/reading event dispatcher
- **Data Validation** — Bounds checking with `ReadingValidator`
- **CO₂ Thresholds** — Helpers for green/amber/red status
- **Mock Device** — For testing without hardware

### Supported Devices

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Aranet4 | <Badge text="Full Support" variant="success" /> |
| Aranet2 | <Badge text="Full Support" variant="success" /> |
