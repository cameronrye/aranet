description: Learn how to set up and use the Aranet Rust ecosystem for environmental sensor monitoring.

import { Steps, Aside, Badge, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Aranet Rust ecosystem provides a complete solution for interacting with Aranet environmental sensors via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Rust 1.90+** installed ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- A Bluetooth-enabled computer (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
- An Aranet sensor device

<Aside type="tip">
  On Linux, you'll need `libdbus-1-dev` installed for BLE support:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
  ```
</Aside>

## Supported Devices

| Device | Sensors | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Aranet4 | CO₂, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure | <Badge text="Full Support" variant="success" /> |
| Aranet2 | Temperature, Humidity | <Badge text="Full Support" variant="success" /> |
| AranetRn+ | Radon, Temperature, Pressure, Humidity | <Badge text="Full Support" variant="success" /> |
| Aranet Radiation | Dose Rate, Total Dose | <Badge text="Full Support" variant="success" /> |

## Project Structure

The Aranet ecosystem consists of six crates:

```
aranet/
├── crates/
│   ├── aranet-types/    # Shared types (platform-agnostic)
│   ├── aranet-core/     # Core BLE library
│   ├── aranet-store/    # Local SQLite data persistence
│   ├── aranet-cli/      # Command-line interface
│   ├── aranet-tui/      # Terminal UI dashboard
│   ├── aranet-gui/      # Desktop GUI (egui)
│   └── aranet-wasm/     # WebAssembly module
└── docs/                # Protocol documentation
```

## Next Steps

<Steps>
1. [Install the CLI](/aranet/docs/installation/) from source
2. [Scan for devices](/aranet/docs/quick-start/) nearby
3. [Read sensor data](/aranet/docs/cli/commands/) from your Aranet device
4. Explore the [BLE Protocol](/aranet/docs/protocol/overview/) documentation
</Steps>
