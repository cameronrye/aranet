## Build from Source

The Aranet tools are currently distributed via source. Once published to crates.io, installation will be simpler.

<Steps>
1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cameronrye/aranet.git
   cd aranet
   ```

2. **Build all crates**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run the CLI**

   ```bash
   ./target/release/aranet --help
   ```
</Steps>

## Platform-Specific Notes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    No additional dependencies required. Bluetooth access will prompt for permission on first use.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    Install the D-Bus development library:
    ```bash
    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev

    # Fedora
    sudo dnf install dbus-devel

    # Arch
    sudo pacman -S dbus
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    No additional dependencies required. Ensure Bluetooth is enabled in Windows settings.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing the CLI Globally

To install the CLI to your Cargo bin directory:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/aranet-cli
```

This allows you to run `aranet` from anywhere:

```bash
aranet scan
```

## Shell Completions

Generate shell completions for your shell:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    ```bash
    aranet completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/aranet
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Zsh">
    ```bash
    aranet completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_aranet
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fish">
    ```bash
    aranet completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/aranet.fish
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using as a Library

Add `aranet-core` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aranet-core = { git = "https://github.com/cameronrye/aranet.git" }
```

<Aside>
  Once published to crates.io, you'll be able to use:
  ```toml
  aranet-core = "0.1"
  ```
</Aside>

## Verify Installation

Check that everything is working:

```bash
# Show version
aranet --version

# Scan for devices (requires Bluetooth)
aranet scan --timeout 5
```
