title: Roadmap
description: Development roadmap and future plans for the Aranet Rust ecosystem.
---

import { Badge, Card, CardGrid, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Aranet project aims to be the definitive Rust ecosystem for Aranet environmental sensors, with feature parity to [Aranet4-Python](https://github.com/Anrijs/Aranet4-Python) and beyond.

## Current Status

| Phase | Component | Status | Progress |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 0 | Foundation | <Badge text="DONE" variant="success" /> | README, LICENSE, CI, CHANGELOG |
| 1 | Core Library | <Badge text="DONE" variant="success" /> | Full BLE stack tested with hardware |
| 2 | CLI Tool | <Badge text="WIP" variant="caution" /> | Commands defined, core integration pending |
| 3 | TUI Dashboard | <Badge text="WIP" variant="caution" /> | App shell complete |
| 4 | GUI Application | <Badge text="WIP" variant="caution" /> | egui shell works |
| 5 | WASM Module | <Badge text="WIP" variant="caution" /> | Basic init/log, Web Bluetooth pending |

## Phase 2: CLI Tool

<Steps>
1. Wire `scan` command to aranet-core
2. Wire `read` command with JSON output
3. Wire `history` command with CSV export
4. Wire `info` and `set` commands
5. Add colored output with status indicators
6. Add progress bars for history download
</Steps>

## Phase 3: TUI Dashboard

Real-time terminal monitoring with ratatui:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Live Readings" icon="random">
    Display current values with auto-refresh
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Device" icon="list-format">
    Monitor multiple sensors simultaneously
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sparklines" icon="bars">
    Historical chart visualization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Alerts" icon="warning">
    Visual alerts for CO₂ thresholds
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Phase 4: GUI Application

Native desktop app with egui:

- Device discovery UI
- Real-time readings dashboard
- Historical data charts
- Settings configuration
- System tray / menubar icon
- Notifications for thresholds
- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Phase 5: WASM Web App

Browser-based Aranet monitor:

- Web Bluetooth device discovery (Chrome/Edge)
- Real-time dashboard UI
- Historical data download
- PWA support (installable, offline)
- CSV export
- Chart visualizations

**Note:** Web Bluetooth only works in Chromium browsers (~50% browser support). iOS Safari does NOT support Web Bluetooth.

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All Python library features working in Rust
- [ ] Single binary CLI with no runtime dependencies
- [ ] TUI monitoring multiple devices simultaneously
- [ ] GUI app installable on all platforms
- [x] WASM app deployed to GitHub Pages *(this site!)*
- [ ] Published to crates.io as `aranet`
- [x] All dependencies on latest stable versions
- [x] Zero `cargo audit` warnings

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Areas where help is especially appreciated:

1. **Testing with hardware** — Help test with Aranet2, Radiation sensors
2. **GUI/TUI polish** — UI/UX improvements
3. **Documentation** — Examples, tutorials, translations
4. **Web Bluetooth** — WASM integration expertise
